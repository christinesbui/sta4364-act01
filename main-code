# PROBLEM 1
# importing file using read.csv and omitting missing values 
auto <- read.csv("Auto.csv", TRUE)
head(auto)
na.omit(auto)

# part (a)
# view which predictors are qualitative or quantitative 
sapply(auto, class)
# origin has values from 1-3 which means 1-3 represent different origins 
head(unique(auto$name[auto$origin == 1]), 30)       # 1 = U.S. made
head(unique(auto$name[auto$origin == 2]), 30)       # 2 = Europe made
head(unique(auto$name[auto$origin == 3]), 30)       # 3 = Japan made

# converting origin into factor/character and converting horsepower into numeric
auto$origin <- factor(auto$origin, levels = 1:3, labels = c("U.S", "Europe", "Japan"))
auto$horsepower <- as.numeric(c(auto$horsepower)) 
sapply(auto, class)

# view which predictors are now quantitative and leftover is qualitative 
quant <- sapply(auto, is.numeric)
quant

# there are 2 qualitative predictors (name and origin) 
# there are 7 quantitative predictors (mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and year)

# part (b)
# checks range of the quantitative predictors
sapply(auto[, quant], range) 

# part (c)
# generates the mean and standard deviation of quantiative predictors
sapply(auto[, quant], function(x) signif(c(mean(x), sd(x)), 2))

# part (d)
obs <- sapply(auto[-10:-85, quant], function(x) round(c(range(x), mean(x), sd(x))))
# create rows that display the range (min and max), mean, and standard deviation
rownames(obs) <- c("min", "max", "mean", "sd")
obs

# part (e)
# pairs generates multiple charts, only using quantitative predictors 
pairs(~mpg + cylinders + displacement + horsepower + weight + acceleration + year, data = auto) 

# some findings: 
# charts demonstrate mpg having a negative relationship with displacement and weight; mpg has a positive relationship with acceleration and year
# charts demonstrate displacement having a positive relationship with weight 
# charts demonstrate weight having a negative relationship with year
# some charts show no significant relationship to each other such as mpg and horsepower, horsepower and weight, horsepower and acceleration, etc. (usually the clustered scatter plots)

# part (e)
# yes, some plots do suggest that some predictors may be useful in predicting mpg.
# for instance, mpg has a positive relationship with acceleration and year (as mentioned in my findings earlier)
# which means as acceleration and year increase, then mpg will also increase. 
# therefore, acceleration and year might be useful in predicting mpg!



# PROBLEM 2 
# importing file using read.table 
cod <- read.table("CodParasite.txt", TRUE)
head(cod)

# generating boxplots of number of parasites (Intensity) conditional on Area, Sex, Stage, and Year
# also taking log transform of Intensity 
boxplot(log(cod$Intensity + 1) ~ Area, data = cod, ylab = "Intensity")
boxplot(log(cod$Intensity + 1) ~ Sex, data = cod, ylab = "Intensity")
boxplot(log(cod$Intensity + 1) ~ Stage, data = cod, ylab = "Intensity")
boxplot(log(cod$Intensity + 1) ~ Year, data = cod, ylab = "Intensity")


# the conditional variable that has an association with number of parasites is area
# i compared the medians to see if they overlapped one another
# if there is an overlap, there's less association; if there is no overlap, there's higher association 
# area 4 boxplot does not overlap with areas 1-3 boxplots; all other conditional variables have medians that overlap each other


# PROBLEM 3
# importing file using read.table
owl <- read.table("Owls.txt", TRUE)
head(owl)

# generating boxplots conditional on SexParent, FoodTreatment, and all combos of SexParent and FoodTreatment
boxplot(NegPerChick ~ SexParent, data = owl)
boxplot(NegPerChick ~ FoodTreatment, data = owl)
boxplot(NegPerChick ~ SexParent * FoodTreatment, data = owl)

# generating boxplot of NegPerChick and Nest
boxplot(NegPerChick ~ Nest, data = owl)

# yes, there are differences for NegPerChick across nesting sites 
# when comparing the medians of all the boxplots, the only one that does not overlap is Sevaz 
# therefore, there is a difference across nesting sites 

# generating scatterplot of NegPerChick and SiblingNegotiation
plot(NegPerChick ~ SiblingNegotiation, data = owl)

# yes, there is an association between NegPerChick and SiblingNegotiation
# there is a positive association between NegPerChick and SiblingNegotiation because as one variable increases then the other also increases

# generating scatterplot of SiblingNegotiation and ArrivalTime
# also taking the log transform of SiblingNegotiation 
plot(log(owl$SiblingNegotiation + 1) ~ ArrivalTime, data = owl, ylab = "SiblingNegotiation")
