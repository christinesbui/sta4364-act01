data analysis and visualization 

### problem 1:
involves the Auto dataset. make sure that missing values are removed from the data.\
(a) which of the predictors are quantitative, and which are qualitative?\
(b) what is the range of each quantitative predictor?\
(c) what is the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative predictor?\
(d) now remove the 10th through 85th observations. what is the range, mean, and standard deviation of each predictor in the subset of the data that remains?\
(e) using full dataset, investigate predictors graphically, using scatterplots or other tools. create some plots highlighting the relationships among predictors. comment on your findings.\
(f) suppose we wish to predict gas mileag (mpg) on the basis of other variables. do your plots suggest that any of the other variables might be useful in predicting mpg? 

### problem 2:
involves making plots to summarize information from the CodParasit.txt dataset. make a boxplot of the number of parasites (intensity) and number of boxplots in each plot should equal number of categories in the conditional variable. comment on which conditional variables appear to have an association with the number of parasites. 

### problem 3:
involves making plots to summarize information from the Owls.txt dataset. the response variable is NegPerChick, representing number of negotiations with a parent that a chick must make before it is fed.
